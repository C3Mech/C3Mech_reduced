# Latest release (V4.0.1)
**C3MechLiteV4.0.1 and C3MechCoreV4.0.1** are available.

**C3MechLiteV4.0.1 and C3MechCoreV4.0.1** are two reduced reaction mechanisms targeting C0–C3 chemical species, including NH3. This repository is linked to the publication ["C3MechLite: An integrated component library of compact kinetic mechanisms for low-carbon, carbon neutral and zero-carbon fuels"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2025.114410) and its ["forthcoming Corrigendum"](link-to-be-added-upon-publication).
