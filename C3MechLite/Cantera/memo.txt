The mechanism files placed in the "Source" directory are the ones used to generate Cantera-compatible mechanism files (.yaml).

Chemkin mechanisms allow setting individual parameters for specific third bodies using the keywords LOWMX/TROEMX and LOWSP/TROESP, which are used for the reaction H+O2(+M)=HO2(+M). However, since Cantera does not support these keywords, attempting to compile the mechanisms in the Chemkin folder for Cantera will result in errors.

To avoid this, the mechanism files included in the folder define H+O2(+N2)=HO2(+N2) and H+O2(+HE)=HO2(+HE) separately for compilation.
Due to this reason, the numbers of reactions differ between Chemkin and Cantera mechanisms. The reported numbers in the manuscript are for Cantera mechanism.
